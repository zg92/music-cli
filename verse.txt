I sent for my baby, and she dont come
I sent for my baby, man, and she dont come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure cant help her none

And if she gets unruly, thinks she dont want do
If she gets unruly, and thinks she dont want do
Take my 32-20, and cut her half in two

She got a thirty-eight special, but I believe its most too light
She got a thirty-eight special, but I believe its most too light
I got a 32-20, got to make the camps alright

If I send for my baby, man, and she dont come
If I send for my baby, man, and she dont come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure can't help her none

I'm gonna shoot my pistol, gonna shoot my Gatlin gun
I'm gonna shoot my pistol, gonna shoot my Gatlin gun
You made me love you, now your man have come

Aw baby, where you stay last night?
Ah baby, where you stay last night?
You got your hair all tangled, and you aint talkin right

Got a thirty-eight special, boys, it do very well
Got a thirty-eight special, boys, it do very well
I Got a 32-20 now, and it's a burnin hell

If I send for my baby, man and she dont come
If I send for my baby, man and she dont come
All the doctors in West Memphis sure cant help her none

Hey hey baby, where you stay last night
Hey hey baby, where you stayed last night
You didn't come home until the sun was shinin bright

Ah boys, I just cant take my rest
Ah boys, I just cant take my rest
With this 32-20 layin up and down my breast 

Early this morning when you knocked upon my door
Early this morning, when you knocked upon my door
And I said hello Satan I believe it's time to go

Me and the Devil was walking side by side
Me and the Devil was walking side by side
And I'm going to beat my woman til I get satisfied

She said you dont see why that she would dog me round
She say you dont see why, that she would dog me round
It must-a be that old evil spirit so deep down in the ground

You may bury my body down by the highway side
You may bury my body down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride
